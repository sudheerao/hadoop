/**
 * IO Statistics.
 * <p>
 *   These are low-cost per-instance statistics provided by any IO components.
 * <p>
 * The statistics MUST BE for the specific instance of the source;
 * possibly including aggregate statistics from other objects
 * created by that stores.
 * For example, the statistics of a filesystem instance must be unique
 * to that instant and not shared with any other.
 * However, those statistics may also collect and aggregate statistics
 * generated in the use of input and output streams created by that
 * file system instance.
 *
 * <p>
 * The iterator is a possibly empty iterator over all monitored statistics.
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     The attributes of an instance can be probed for with
 *     {@link #hasAttribute(Attributes)}.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The set of statistic keys SHOULD remain unchanged, and MUST NOT
 *     ever remove keys.
 *   </li>
 *     The statistics MAY BE dynamic: every call to {@code iterator()}
 *     MAY return a current/recent set of statistics.
 *     This
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The values MAY change across invocations of {@code iterator()}.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The update MAY be in the iterable() call, or MAY be in the actual
 *     Iterable.next() operation.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The returned Map.Entry instances MUST return the same value on
 *     repeated getValue() calls.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Queries of statistics SHOULD Be fast and Nonblocking to the extent
 *     that if invoked during a long operation, they will prioritize
 *     returning fast over most timely values.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     The statistics MAY lag; especially for statistics collected in separate
 *     operations (e.g stream IO statistics as provided by a filesystem
 *     instance).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     Thread safety: an instance of IOStatistics can be shared across threads;
 *     a call to @code iterator()} is thread safe.
 *     The actual Iterable returned MUST NOT be shared across threads.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     If the instance declares that it has the attribute {@link Attributes#Snapshotted},
 *     then it will take a snapshot of the attribute values in the call {@link #snapshot()}.
 *     These values MUST NOT change until a subsequent snapshot() operation.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     A snapshot MAY NOT be consistent, i.e. during the snapshot operation
 *     the underlying values may change.
 *   </li>
 *
 * </ol>
